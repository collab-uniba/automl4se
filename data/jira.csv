Jonathan - are you still in the loop on this one?  What do you think?

We can add this functionality to load the proxy services only at the startup time from the registry (this doesn't mean they are dynamic) but I don't see any value there.

Why would you need to have the schema in two places?  My DIH config doesn't mention any field names because all Solr field names match the MySQL field names.  Even if they didn't I'm not sure why it would be any different than any other SolrJ client which doesn't need to have a copy of the schema.  bq.

While I know Mike's original patch went this way with LUCENE-2392 (e.g. norms) I'm not sure i like it being in Similarity in the future either.  Otherwise concepts like lazy-loading norms and all this other stuff get pushed onto the sim which is an awkward place (imagine if you have many fields).   So I think we shouldn't really design for abuses of the API. If there are other use cases for ""named similarity"" that have to do with term weighting I'm interested. "

"neutral","Of course I totally agree with Yonik.  I don't care that much what the default include is (upper lower ...) as long as it doesn't double-count. Double-counting is bad -- it can lead to a bad user experience. There's something about ""lower"" that I feel makes it slightly better than ""upper"" but I can't really explain the rationale. I don't think there's any point in compliance with legacy if nobody depended on the behavior (they couldn't specify the behavior before either).  Just because its easy to set the include doesn't mean the default is arbitrary.  Any way if the default remains to double-count I'm going to insist that my readers for the second edition of my book change this value."

"positive","[~bikassaha] Thanks for the heads-up Bikas! This JIRA is not concerned with the Tez integration for Pig and is simply the abstraction in Pig to allow for alternate ExecutionEngines in Pig. But will certainly change this on the Tez integration side of stuff.  Thanks a lot [~cheolsoo] for continuing this! I think everything looks good from my end. I can certainly see why we may want to keep this on a different branch until everything is finalized. Certain things may still need more work. For example OutputStats is not completed abstracted out as it still has references to POStore which is a MR implementation construct. ScriptState/PPNL/JobStats may still need more abstraction (especially PPNL) and reworking to incorporate a new ExecutionEngine abstraction. I think what we have done here is the minimum foundation for an abstraction though and it would be appropriate to put into trunk but these are not my decisions to make.   With regard to public methods that were changed I don't think most of them are a big deal besides as Cheolsoo said the PigServer throwing PigException. I never thought IOException was a good exception to throw but I think reverting PigServer back to IOException as it is userfacing code is not a big deal. The rest of the method signature changes shouldn't be worrisome because most of them are internal to the project.   However the change from JobStats to MRJobStats while necessary (as each ExecutionEngine would have it's own type of JobStats it would present to the end user) could be problematic because it is userfacing code and would probably break people who were previously using JobStats. That I think is the most important thing to keep in mind. The task of making the PPNL and JobStats clearly tied to the ExecutionEngine should be thought through also."

"positive","bq. Though pig itself compiled fine and is ready to go the contrib projects (owlzebrapiggybank/hiverc) didnt compile I think because either it didn't download dependices of those projects or didn't include them in the build path.  Ashutosh yes. I did realize it and as you rightly guessed it is because the ivy-dependency list doesn't have some jars that are actually being used by contrib packages. This is not an issue related to eclipse-classpath. However there has to be a JIRA opened to solve this issue of downloading the missing jars by ivy.   Can you please file a JIRA for this? Thanks"

"neutral","Using nutch with solr has been a very demanding request so it will be very useful when this makes into trunk. I have spend some time reviewing the patch which I find quite elegant.   Some improvements to the patch would be  - make NutchDocument implement VersionedWritable instead of writable and delegate version checking to superclass - refactor getDetails() methods in HitDetailer to Searcher (it is not likely that a class would implement Searcher but not HitDetailer) - use Searcher delete HitDetailer and SearchBean  - Rename XXXBean classes so that they do not include ""bean"". (I think it is confusing to have bean objects that have non-trivial functionality) - refactor LuceneSearchBean.VERSION to RPCSearchBean - remove unrelated changes from the patch.(the changes in NGramProfile HTMLLanguageParserLanguageIdentifier... correct me if i'm wrong)  As far as i can see we do not need any metadata for Solr backend and only need StoreIndex and Vector options for lucene backend so i think we can simplify NutchDocument#metadata.

If it's more of an example for the book it could be attached to the book. If it stays that's cool too just need to have a think about fixing/documenting the issues raised here.  You've raised a different an interesting point about performance though. You find that the slow-down is actually in addToVector where it converts a String to byte[]? The thing is the corresponding line in the ""fast"" version skips this step and adds null.  Indeed also passing null in the ""normal"" version makes it twice as fast for me. It's still twice as slow as the ""fast"" version though. But I do wonder whether the example deserves a bit more attention. I may not know what I'm doing.

"neutral","{quote} This wasn't a problem with my patch right?  That was an issue of the mahout script in trunk itself? {quote}  Yes it was a problem with the script in trunk. I believe this was due to the fact that the job files were on the classpath instead of all of the dependency jars. Adding the job files to the classpath does not add the dependency jars they contain to the classpath as well. So no you didn't add this but it should be fixed (and is in the patch)  {quote} What is the -core option for?  I've never used it how does it work? {quote}  when you're running bin/mahout in the context of a build the -core option is used to tell it to use the build classpath instead of the classpath used for a binary release. This just follows the pattern established (by Doug?) in the hadoop and nutch launch scripts.  {quote} Also added a help message for the 'run' argument. {quote}  near line 72 in bin/mahout: (this is different from the --help question I had)  {code}   echo ""  seq2sparse            generate sparse vectors from a sequence file""   echo ""  vectordump            dump vectors from a sequence file""   echo ""  run                   run mahout tasks using the MahoutDriver see: http://cwiki.apache.org/MAHOUT/mahoutdriver.html"" {code}  {quote} So you already added the ability to load via classpath right? If we merge that way of thinking with what I'm currently working on (having a configurable ""MAHOUT_CONF_DIR"" which is used for all these props files) we could just have the mahout shell script just add MAHOUT_CONF_DIR to the classpath (the way you already have it adding the hardwired core/src/main/resources directory) and then it would work that way. {quote}  Yep that should do it as long as MAHOUT_CONF_DIR appears before src/main/resources we should be good to go. It should be added outside of the section of the script that determines if -core has been specified on the command-line.  "

It's already hard to support just these two (see LUCENE-4610 and LUCENE-4600) and it's not at all clear how to support arbitrary OrdinalPoilcy-ies that users will provide. ** Rather if one really wishes to encode only say levels 3 and below he can extend FacetFields and provide his own CategoryListBuilder. ** For the search side he'll need to provide whatever will work for him (I cannot even describe here what API exactly because of the complexity)  * Nuke PathPolicy. One can extend FacetFields and provide his own DrillDownStream. I'll need to check about that one but it looks like we can get rid of it too."
"neutral","I just glanced through in general: this is similar to the hack patch i used exploring LUCENE-4089 though I just used a Map<StringString>.  The part i didnt like when exploring was more related to how term index/term dictionary are separated: {quote} divisor: generalize this into something simple like a Map<StringString> of codec ""parameters"" that you set on IWC/IR. split divisor from ""don't load terms index"". define these as constants where they belong. I got unhappy here in the ""splitting"" part because I wanted the divisor part in TermsIndexReaderBase but that doesnt extend FieldsProducer (where i wanted the ""don't load"" part) and wrap the terms dict instead its backwards and terms dict wraps the TermsIndexReaderBase... maybe we should fix that too? I think this confusing the way it is but I didnt look at how difficult this would be. {quote}  But I think maybe I was trying to tackle too much at once... still as an ""untyped"" parameter I thought it would be useful to fix the semantics all in one break rather than causing confusion down the road.

We finally decided to simply have them as a stand-alone project living within the same repository space with a stored versioned binary artefact updated when tools had to be updated (rarely). This does version a binary file but you don't need to worry about recompiling things over and over.  +1 to do this for this and any other Lucene/Solr Ant tasks."
"positive","Thanks Dawid.  bq. Yes this is pretty much the top-n nodes reordering that I did albeit without any optimization of how many n to take (the hardcoded magic constants should probably be justified somehow? Or replaced by a default in FST somewhere?).  bq. Deciding how many nodes to reorder is I think hard – I failed to provide any sensible fast heuristic for that and I simply do a simulated annealing to find a local optimum.  Yeah the algo is simplistic now... and it does force caller to pick the params (though minInCountDeref=3 and maxDerefNodes=Inf are probably pretty good)... we can and should make it more sophisticated over time.  We have at least one spare bit to still use in the arc flags :)  bq. One thing I was wondering is why you decided to integrate the packer with the fst – wouldn't it be cleaner to separate packing from construction? Granted this requires a double pass over the fst nodes and more intermediate memory but it wouldn't add any more complexity to the builder which is already ehm a bit complex . You can compare this design in Morfologik:  Well... it's tricky.  First I decided to change node targets to ords so that pack could use an array to (relatively!) efficiently hold node data eg inCount newAddress etc.  That required making the first pass FST ""modal"" (deref'd or not).  If we didn't do this then the packer would have to use even less RAM efficient data structures (eg Map<IntX>) I think?  Second the format written by the packer is tightly coupled with the FST reading ie there are sizable differences when reading packed vs unpacked FST.  But I agree it'd be cleaner if we could move packing out (eg Util.pack) and more strongly decouple packing from FST format...  One thing I'd really like to somehow do is create different classes for FST writing vs reading and different classes for each format.  We now have write-ord write-non-ord read-packed read-unpacked (and even the two readers have 3 different modes depending on INPUT_TYPE).  "
"neutral","From the dev list didn't want to lose this background (or make Uwe type it again <G>)  The idea was to maybe replace RAMDirectory by a “clone‿ of MMapDirectory that uses large DirectByteBuffers outside the JVM heap. The current RAMDirectory is very limited (buffersize hardcoded to 8 KB if you have a 50 Gigabyte Index in this RAMDirectory your GC simply drives crazy – we investigated this several times for customers. RAMDirectory was in fact several times slower than a simple disk-based MMapDir). Also the locking on the RAMFile class is horrible as for large indexes you have to change buffer several times when seeking/reading/… which does heavily locking. In contrast MMapDir is completely lock-free!   Until there is no replacement we will not remove it but the current RAMDirectory is not useable for large indexes. That’s a limitation and the design of this class does not support anything else. It’s currently unfixable and instead of putting work into fixing it the time should be spent in working on a new ByteBuffer-based RAMDir with larger blocs/blocs that merge or IOContext helping to calculate the file size before writing it (e.g. when triggering a merge you know the approximate size of the file before so you can allocate a buffer that’s better than 8 Kilobytes). Also directByteBuffer helps to make GC happy as the RAMdir is outside JVM heap.....  RAMdir uses more time for switching buffers than reading the data. The problem is that MMapDir does not support *writing* and that why we plan to improve this. Have you tried MMapDir for read access in comparison to RAMDirectory for a larger index it outperforms several times (depending on OS and if file data is in FS cache already). The new directory will simply mimic the MMapIndexInput add MMapIndexOutput but not based on a mmapped buffer instead a in-memory (Direct)ByteBuffer (outside or inside JVM heap – both will be supported). This simplifies code a lot.   The discussions about the limitations of crappy RAMDirectory were discussed on conferences sorry. We did *not*decide to remove it (without a patch/replacement). The whole “message‿ on the issue was that RAMDirectory is a bad idea. The recommended approach at the moment to handle large in-ram directories would be to use a tmpfs on Linux/Solaris and use MMapDir on top (for larger indexes). The MMap would then directly map the RAM of the underlying tmpfs..... "

So you get both incremental building and immutability. {quote}  Oh yeah.  But then we'd clone the full IWC on every set... this seems like overkill in the name of ""purity"".  {quote} What about earlier compromise mentioned by Shay Mark me? Keep setters for 'live' properties on IW. This clearly draws the line and you don't have to consult Javadocs for each and every setting to know if you can change it live or not. {quote}  I really don't like that this approach would split IW configuration into two places.  Like you look at the javadocs for IWC and think that you cannot change the RAM buffer size.  IWC should be the one place you go to see which settings you can change about the IW.  That some of these settings take effect ""live"" while others do not is really an orthogonal (and I think secondary ie handled fine w/ jdocs) aspect/concern. "

How would we support Factories loading unrelated classes like they can through ResourceLoader now? Assume they're on the classpath and use Class.forName? {quote}  It needs more discussion (and input from Uwe would help!) but it works like Charset.forName(""ASCII"") etc. We use this already for codecs and postingsformats (Codec.forName Codec.listAllCodecs ...).  Have a look at lucene/core/src/resources/META-INF/services for the idea. Basically you ""register"" your classes in your jar file this way: additional jar files (e.g. look at lucene/test-framework/src/resources/META-INF) can load more classes.  So this could support some idea like TokenizerFactory.forName(""Whitespace"") or something simple like that. So someone would not need to use org.apache.solr.analysis.xxx namespace to be able to load their analyzer stuff easily they use whatever package they want and register in their META_INF. And added jar files (other analysis jars) are automatically available this way.  I think Uwe mentioned this idea before though I think he had Analyzers in mind (e.g. provide language code and get back analyzer or something). Anyway thats for another issue :)  Just something worth consideration if we want to make these modules really pluggable.

EG I made it the StandardTermsDictReader's job to seek the termsIn file I moved docCount ""up"" and I made a single cache entry.  I think I also removed a few attrs that we didn't need to store... and downgraded skipOffset from long -> int (it's int on trunk)."

Does one of them fail because it fails to register metrics? Ditto for Producers.  61. ConsumerTopicStats: What if a topic is named AllTopics? We use to handle this by adding a - in topic specific stats.  62. ZookeeperConsumerConnector: Do we need to validate groupid?  63. ClientId: Does the clientid length need to be different from topic length?  64. AbstractFetcherThread: When building a fetch request do we need to pass in brokerInfo as part of the client id? BrokerInfo contains the source broker info and the fetch requests are always made to the source broker.  "
"neutral","Thanks for getting started on this. I have a couple of requests -  1. Could you please upload a patch to this JIRA and grant it to Apache ?  2. This patch doesn't apply cleanly to trunk would you mind updating a patch that would ?   It will make it much easier for us to review it.   Also when you said the zk connect option hangs did you get a chance to take a look at the debug/trace logs to see where it hangs ? Do you mind uploading those log files here ?"
"neutral","Hi ShengTao you would think if you follow:  1. Check if the service is there add if it is not. 2. Then add a bindingTemplate.  Then you would not be overwriting a bindingTemplates. You are right though if you are saving a service it will overwrite the existing one and it will remove any bindingTemplates if they are there. The current behavior is how the UDDI v3 spec tells us to so it but we could add a config option to differentiate from the spec.  Please let me know if you are following the above strategy and *still* seeing issues.   --Kurt  "

I'm working on a garbage collector for the data store. The GC doesn't care about user rights or putting it another way it must be able to access all workspaces. Ideally I'd like to use a SystemSession but you can't get one outside RepositoryImpl or o.a.j.c package (i.e. getSystemSession(String) is package private WorkspaceInfo is protected). I understand that these APIs shouldn't be public but they're useful from within the core. In my case for the GC. I'm very interested in using another way to walk every workspace but this other way should guarantee that the repository won't shutdown during a walk operation.

In EditLogFileInputStream why do we need to pass isInProgress as a boolean? If it's in-progress that means we don't know the lastTxId so it would be INVALID_TXID right? So we can implement isInProgress() by just comparing lastTxId.  Because in the case of pre-transactional ELFIS we pass in INVALID_TXID even though the log is not yet in progress.

My points is that I think it is a good idea in general to raise this timeout (while adding configs so you don't necessarily have to wait since smallish clusters could use the max param if they want to speed this up)... we have run into the situation where not all RS came in the 3 second window (which really is too small given heartbeat frequency) so I've already ramped up the config timeout for fb production.

It looks like code is duplicated. Now our vm makes check after parsing and only if -Xverify is on.   I suppose to leave it as it is or make method name check independently of -Xverify flag."

The above isn't complete (it needs e.g. 'read()' and 'seek()' implementations) but it looks like a good start.  But the real question is to you: could you use the above?  Can you present the data and checksums as input streams that support read(byte[] int int) and seek(long)?  It also assumes a particular checksum implementation CRC32.  If we wish to allow for others that aspect could be generalized by adding a codec-like interface for checksummers.  But I think we should probably skip that this iteration. "

I ran without the security manager so I did not get it set.   I do think though that the old behavior was buggy: I can't see why one should need to set derby.system.home explicitly to get the auto-boot behavior.

"neutral","Noah said he’s going to fix this in his build-fauxton branch but I’d like to explain this for posterity.  make indeed throws this error I didn’t suggest it is a grunt.js error but it’s the way we use Autotools. In particular in how we use Autotools for packaging. Each file that is supposed to end up in our final apache-couchdb-x.y.z.tar.gz tarball needs to be marked as such in a Makefile.am. For Fauxton that means we maintain a list of Fauxton files in src/Makefila.am specified as `FAUXTON_FILES`:  FAUXTON_FILES = \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/assets/less/activetasks.less \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/base.js \     fauxton/app/addons/activetasks/resources.js \     …and so on  In that list there is a line: `fauxton/app/initialize.js` e.g. where we say that file is supposed to go into the release tarball. That file however does not exist at the time `make dist` is run so make complains. I assume the solution is that make needs to call grunt at some point to turn fauxton/app/initialize.underscore into fauxton/app/initialize.js and I think that is what Noah is doing in his branch. I just wanted to explain why this isn’t a make error. "

"neutral","Well since you didn't respond to my request I finally did without and checked out what you did.   First of all looking at CIncludeTransformer I have to say that I don't understand why it is doing its own caching. Caching should be the concern of pipelines and sources. If you want preemptive loading of cached content this would much better be implemented as a Source wrapper. In fact we now have such a class in the scratchpad area.  One unpleasant implication of the current design is that as an unsuspecting user of this class when you turn on caching in this transformer the cached contents of any included cocoon:// source that identifies a caching pipeline would be cached twice! Once by the pipeline itself and once by the CIncludeTransformer.  Now concerning your patch. I don't quite understand why you retain the validity of the cached contents. The algorithm the caching pipeline uses to determine the validity of the cached contents is as follows: first it looks at the validity of the cached pipeline contents itself then if the validity by itself indicates it needs a current validity to check against then the pipeline contructs a pipeline validity by calling the participating components' getValidity() methods. If your component now returns the same validity object that you previously returned then  that does not make much sense to me.  Since I really needed this functionality myself and I didn't have enough time to discuss and refactor the CIncludeTransformer I implemented my own very basic IncludeTransformer that does exactly what I need no more no less. I'll post it here if anyone want to use it.  I also looked at the XIncludeTransformer to see if I could implement caching in that one instead. But it seems that the XIncludeTransformer reads included content from URL objects instead of from Source objects."

With the lack of an undo feature the only reasonable thing for me to do is a revert the datamap.  4) I think my font changed for labels.  I'll have to verify that.  Looking at #3 again actually I can't seem to paste at all.  I even tried creating a new DataMap and was unable to paste the ObjEntity to that."
"negative","Sorry it took so long to drag this up.  I think the issue I had was with the Customer => BillingInfo and Customer => ShippingInfo relationships.  BillingInfo and ShippingInfo each inherit from Address.  IIRC a runtime relationship was being created for Customer => Address which was messing things up.  I'll have to dig through the SVN history to see what I did with mandatory relationships that I mentioned being problematic in the initial bug submission."
"neutral","I was actually trying to debug the issue and didn't see anything that looked like it would nuke the DataMap/DataNode under the DataDomain and was wondering if it was a visual issue but didn't try saving the model to see if it had actually deleted it.

"neutral","Not sure if the patch was pushed for review or not. In any case fixing the build is pretty trivial the changes made to ModificationStatement should just be reverted (and we should just pass the CL in argument to executeWithCondition() to SP.cas()).  Other than that: * I believe we now refuse CL.SERIAL for the cas() method (because CL.blockfor() throw an UnsupportedOperationException for SERIAL). Maybe we can make SERIAL mean ""wait for nothing on commit not even a local one"" (which probably amount to making CL.blockfor() return 0 for SERIAL and adding a 'if' in WriteResponseHandler ctor to signal right away if blockfor is 0). * I don't think CL.ANY will really work as for normal writes since we don't generate hints for commit. Maybe we could (generate hints) ultimately btw but in the meantime it might make more sense to refuse it (and thus make the default for CAS be either SERIAL if we do the preceding point or ONE). * We don't call CL.validateForWrite() when calling CAS (and we shouldn't as it complains with SERIAL) but maybe we should add a validateForConditionalWrite that would at least check we have the right replication strategy when using the multi-DC specific CLs."

"neutral","bq. CASSANDRA-2444 got in the way  I'm not sure what the right solution is here.  I buy the premise of 2444 that you don't necessarily want to get hammered by compaction when you're first starting up (warming up caches).  So I don't think ""check for compactions ever N seconds"" is a great policy.  But I'm not sure ""check every N seconds starting M minutes after startup"" is great either because it's not something a user will just guess when he's wondering ""why aren't compactions happening yet?""  Any other ideas?"
"neutral","Split out some fixes to the SSTII bytes tracker getting out of sync w/ the underlying stream and did some cleanup to make the streamed/file versions less divergent.  Also adds parallel compaction testing to LazilyCompactedRowTest.  CliTest and DefsTest generate compaction loads (in DefsTest's case on the Migrations CF -- haven't dug into CliTest as much) that break w/ parallel enabled although the test doesn't actually fail (argh).  Haven't figured out what's causing that and haven't come up with a way to reproduce in a ""real"" test yet.  The DefsTest does mix lazy/nonlazy iteration in the merge which may be relevant.  bq. I'm also no proposing to complicate things.    You're right poor choice of words on my part.  Latest gives the merge executor a SynchronousQueue.  I think that's a better way to cut worst-case than the Deserializer for the reason given previously.  bq. 'if...instanceof' business is a bit error prone/ugly  Agreed.

The bytesRead ""race"" should also be fixed in CompactionIterable  done  bq.

"neutral","I know in your webapp this condition might be fulfilled but GroovyShell is not special to web applications.  "
"neutral","Because of that the default parent is the same loader as the loader that loaded the class GroovyShell - this loader knows the groovy classes."

"neutral","A single table could be made up of many thousands even hundreds of thousands of regions?"
"neutral","bq.In order to maintain different states at which we are in while creating table should we go for a special node under the table znode or can we add new states to the existing table states like (DISABLING ENABLING DISABLED etc) IMO go with separate node."
"neutral","Some further bug tracing shows that pdfbox' RandomAccessBuffer is responsible for the Out of Memory error."
"neutral","The fix is only disabled on releases prior to 10.8.2 on the assumption that the fix gets into the upcoming 10.8.2 release."
"neutral","I don't know that there's an alternative that would be less invasive than reverse logical time."
"neutral","I don't quite see why the attached implementation would do more heap operations but I agree that it could be slower due to lengthier/more complex loops a few more if statements etc."
"neutral","So what this patch does is totally revamps the makefiles for erlang."

"neutral","Sounds reasonable."

"neutral","Content-wise the only part that stuck out to me was the inclusion of the many exceptions that users  will never see."
"neutral","Sounds reasonable to me given it's a standalone (debug) utility."

"neutral","There are just too many checks there that Click is not using and we can't just use them all (many don't make sense to Click at all) :)."

"neutral","That's why I'm going to use easymock as SMSC simulator."
"neutral","This was fixed Cassandra-side for 2.0 in CASSANDRA-5702 but the fix was pretty heavyweight and backporting to 1.2.x is not an option."
"neutral","#NAME?"
"neutral","Please use git diff to generate patch because I can't easily apply git patch on a svn tree."
"neutral","Does that sound like a reasonable plan going forward?"
"neutral","I won't intrude on the design discussion sounds good."

"neutral","[~lfryc] [~bleathem] [~ppitonak] Do you think guys that those page fragments methods which depend on JSON parsing - aka various {{setupFromWidget}} should throw {{UnsupportedOperationException}} till this issue is resolved ?"

"neutral","patch looks good."
"neutral","+1 thanks Ivan."
"neutral","I don't see the issue on trunk."
"neutral","Just realize that."
"neutral","Thanks!"
"neutral","I should have tested with trunk before creating this jira."

"neutral","Jacques if you create separate issues for the erros (icluding the logs) I can take a look them."
"neutral","Thanks for your vote."
"neutral","Any other opinions about the patch?"
"neutral","+1 for the patch."
"neutral","Committed to trunk."
"neutral","Thanks Arpit!"
"neutral","I think your logic is right."
"neutral","1"
"neutral","FileSystemView is the user file system view so it can have canDelete() and canRead() methods ..... this is fine."
"neutral","FileSystemView can have user object to indicate whose file system view it is representing."
"neutral","3"
"neutral","In that case caching will be at the FileSystemView level (not at FileObject level)."
"neutral","Logically this is also fine."
"neutral","NativeFileSystemView represents the underlying OS file system view - no more no less."
"neutral","Caching is a specialized function."
"neutral","So if necessary we can add another FileSystemManager implementation which will support caching."
"neutral","So the action items: 1. canDelete() canRead() and canWrite() will be moved to FileSystemView from FileObject.  "
"neutral","Please review and close out if appropriate."
"neutral","Thanks very much for the contribution."
"neutral","The fixing is available in all builds after r658561."
"neutral","solved in subversion repository as of r818942."
"neutral","Thanks for the patch Gustavo."

"neutral","Applied patch."
"neutral","Thanks!"
"neutral","+1 looks good. "
"neutral","Oh and that wiki page for the shell is slightly formatted wrong by the looks it changes to cursive/italics and stays until the end."

"neutral","Applied the patch to implement Workspace.move"
"neutral","We pretty much already had the interface we wanted for this (IFixedLocationResourceStream)."
"neutral","And then MarkupCache uses that interface to checkout what the actual file is  I dont think we will get IResourceStream implementation that are not File or URL and if we do then we fallback on the cachekey only approache."

"neutral","Just an update:  # SOLR-1131: aka poly fields is almost ready to go."
"neutral","Please review."
"neutral","# SOLR-1297: sort by function query just needs review and then can be committed."
"neutral","After that we can add in the Cartesian Tier indexing and the Cartesian Tier QParserPlugin (after a little re-write)."
"neutral","Then we need pseudo-fields and we likely  want to hook in a per request function cache (maybe)"
"positive","Hi Suran  The new catalogs_b.patch looks very good."
"neutral","It will need another round or two of adjusting but it is definitely looking solid."
"neutral","I have applied the patch and am running regression tests now."
"neutral","I will post my results when the tests finish."
"neutral","In my experience this kind of shadowing always causes bugs in the future because it is so easy to lose track of which copy of the redundant field is being used."
"neutral","So the constructor for this class should call setUUID( permUUID ) rather than stuffing the shadowing field via ""this.permUUID = permUUID""."
"neutral","o Once you do that you can get rid of the getUUID() setUUID() and getObjectID() methods in this class."
"neutral","o I have reservations about the second constructor for this class (the one which is used to create a key descriptor rather than a full-fledged permissions descriptor)."
"neutral","However I see that you are following the data dictionary patterns for the other permissions descriptors."
"neutral","But we should put a sticky note on our brains to remind ourselves to clean up this pattern in the future--partially initialized data is brittle."
"neutral","Don't worry that's another project and not part of the sequence generator work."
"neutral","SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory  o I think that you should flip the order of the keys in the second index."
"neutral","That is the key order should be ( schemaID sequenceName ) rather than ( sequenceName schemaID )."
"neutral","But maybe you have a use for an index with key order ( sequenceName schemaID ) which I'm not seeing."
"neutral","SYSROLESRowFactory  o As with SYSSEQUENCESRowFactory I think that buildColumnList() should return a larger array one cell for each column in the table."
"neutral","DataDictionary  o The header comment for getPermDescriptor() does not seem to describe the method."
"neutral","Thanks -Rick "
"neutral","This one fixes the end-date issue in the comment bean classes: URL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=782269&view=rev  And that resolves this issue in the trunk."
"neutral","Hey Chrisyou just moved the files right?!"
"neutral","Also applies to the 4.x series"
"neutral","Attribute 'width' works fine."
"neutral","Would be nice to have a batch/list functionality as well like we have for deletes/puts."
"neutral","It looks like the problem originates in PDFBOX-11."
"neutral","Many CID mappings are expressed as ranges which the code explodes into individual Integer->String pairs."
"neutral","In the same pc I have a outlook client and It work fine the problem is with xplanner how can I  configurate xplanner for send mails ?"
"neutral","Thanks"
"neutral","ok I'm looking into this."
"neutral","Okay reviewed and tested patch with sqlite3 and bdb on trunk."

"neutral","#NAME?"
"neutral","Have a look at hibernate.common.xml"
"neutral","Hi David  This helps me understand what you were talking about - thanks!"
"neutral","(Things weren't as clear at 2am ))    Yes we should probably definitely be removing the ThreadLocal entirely."
"neutral","I'll make those changes as soon as I can."
"neutral","#NAME?"
"neutral","Patch applied in trunk."
"neutral","Thank you for your contribution."
"neutral","Why use an ad-hoc script that's known (according Erik himself) to have false positive that require manual inspection (which is also not part of the version controlled source tree) when you we have a built-in (aspectj*.jars are already included as build/runtime dependencies) tool specifically for such tasks?"
"neutral","You can do this for info messages too for more performance when that is off."
"neutral","Ah ok ... thanks for the heads up."
"neutral","Changes to the test look good and your method for finding which are right/wrong is correct."
"neutral","I would advise that a good thing to do once you have fixed this issue is to then perform a similar test modification for setting a valid value and using batching."
"neutral","I've started to work towards support for visualising services and cascading configuration."
"neutral","The changes in this patch aren't a complete solution but they're free-standing give basic service visualisation and shared configuration support."
"neutral","I've introduced a decorator framework for relationships so we can draw the service triangles (or package names)."
"neutral","The service handling will need to be updated slightly once we're not working from the DummyInfoProvider."
"neutral","Handling of services which aren't consumed and services which are consumed by multiple bundles is pretty weak."
"neutral","I've also started to add cascading configuration."
"neutral","ComponentAppearances will also inherit from one another when we have nested components (like a bundle inside an application)."
"neutral","I've only switched the ComponentColorElement (which was the ComponentColorProperty) over to use the new configuration so far but I'll switch the other elements over to using the new configuration next."
"neutral","In the new version elements have two methods - render() which draws them and apply() which  initialises shared properties like colour."
"neutral","This allows for a two-phase rendering."
"positive",":)  I've renamed ComponentColorProperty to be ComponentColorElement and RelationshipAggregation to TwistieAggregation."
"neutral","I've also moved RelationshipElement to the elements namespace."
"positive","Looks like this is fixed :)"
"positive","Version 2.2.0RC3 is fine."
"positive","Sounds like a good idea."
"neutral","For the CAMEL-3787 I think the key should be on the ftp client configure to find out right charset that the server is using."
"neutral","> MultipartEntity entity = new MultipartEntity(HttpMultipartMode.BROWSER_COMPATIBLE)   Use strict mode instead of browser compatibility."

"neutral","Thanks for supplying the patch."
"neutral","Please close this bug if this is ok for you."
"neutral","I showed my interest on this idea in the dev-mailing list and currently started to explore the requirements and a design. "
"neutral","Thanks"
"neutral","OK will open the issue with Solr/Lucene."
"positive","Many thanks for your help."
"neutral","Does this applies to 0.22 trunk or 0.23 trunk?"
"neutral","Thanks."
"neutral","I found the note in the manual about @Resource and that fixes it."
"neutral","At this point I'd suggest  peppering the docs with references to @Resource wherever it discusses autowiring things or about collections."
"neutral","E.g. ""note: if you're trying to auto wire a collection with annotations you'll need to use @Resource instead of @Autowired""."
"neutral","I looked at all the TODO's in uimaj-core and found only one Sofa-related exception that needed update."

"neutral","Jacopo  Thanks for diving in a pointing Scott at the appropriate screens."
"neutral","David  I completely agree that providing more intelligence in the PO creation process would be very helpful especially for larger businesses."
"neutral","I can just about cope with the amount of manual intervention required but in the not too distant future I can see the need for some of the rules you suggest."

"neutral","Please keep this open until reverse tests are configured as we might have new issues coming from them."
"neutral","Ok got it thanks for the explanation."
"neutral","In any case the code for the toBytes method is written now so it should be a simple thing to move it to the PType implementation classes."
"neutral","It would probably also be worth having optimized versions for primitive values instead of writing them to an Avro/Writable first to get the bytes representation."

"neutral","One of the things I changed in jnr-posix was to make stat and fstat use stati64 and fstati64 respectively instead of stat64 and fstat - the last may be why its breaking with jna-posix."
"neutral","Look in WindowsLibCFunctionMapper.java for the fstat mapping - it may all magically work if you change fstat to map to _fstat64 (note: no 'i' in the name - uses stat64 struct instead of stati64 ... they have different sized atime ctime mtime fields)."
"neutral","Otherwise the WindowsFileStat structure looks ok apart from the st_blocks and st_blksize fields at the end which are not part of the windows stat64 struct so will probably be filled with either zero or garbage.  "

"neutral","Soundararajan Ning - Yes I am planning on working on it starting next week."
"neutral","I expect this to take at least upto mid to late in the week in order to get a patch available for this."
"neutral","Alexei this patch is quite out of date (sorry about that)."
"neutral","Please can you provide an updated patch?"
"neutral","Thanks Tim"
"neutral","If we redid the meta tables in this format we'd be using an access that is natural to hbase a scan as opposed to the perverse expensive getClosestRowBefore we currently have that has to walk backward in meta finding a containing region."
"neutral","This issue is about changing the way we name regions."
"neutral","Converting to the new method we'd have to run a migration on startup changing the content in meta."
"neutral","Up to this the randomid component of a region name has been the timestamp of region creation."
"neutral","HBASE-2531 ""32-bit encoding of regionnames waaaaaaayyyyy too susceptible to hash clashes"" proposes changing the randomid so that it contains actual name of the directory in the filesystem that hosts the region."
"neutral","If we had this in place I think it would help with the migration to this new way of doing the meta because as is the region name in fs is a hash of regionname... changing the format of the regionname would mean we generate a different hash... so we'd need hbase-2531 to be in place before we could do this change."
"neutral","The two machines do not share the filesystem."
"neutral","There is an embedded Tomcat running in the same JVM but according to the logs the database is not booted twice."
"neutral","The only reasons for the failure I can think of were the failed network connections the OutOfMemoryError or the 4000+ simultaneous connections together with lock timeouts."
"neutral","Ah and I am running 10.2 SVN 540841 as this fixes DERBY-2549."
"neutral","#NAME?"

"neutral","Aaron: I completely agree the parser needs to be changed but I don't currently have the time available."
"neutral","My goal here is a very small/quick change to revert how every FsShell command (except count) to how it used to work."
"neutral","If you're ok with that I think another jira should switch the parser."
"neutral","Todd: I suppose it comes down to whether hadoop should favor posix or gnu extensions?"
"positive","Thanks Todd glad to be on board!"
"neutral","I tested this again on Ubuntu 10.04 This works with the new Tomcat instance and then when I tried the 2nd time it is not working."
"neutral","But when i delete the file which was created at <tomcat-home>/bin/search-index/write.lock  it works fine  but I'm not sure whether this creates other implications?"
"neutral","Further I think the tags are not saved any ware because after redeploying I found the tags I added are missing."
"neutral","Is this due to the deletion of write.lock"
"neutral","From the logs it is clear that the reducers could not fetch the output for map attempt attempt_200905051023_1155_m_000036."
"neutral","Both the reducers (and possibly everybody else) is waiting on these."
"neutral","There is something mysterious going on here."
"neutral","If attempt id 1 was speculative the framework would not have killed it as the original attempt was a failure."
"neutral","In any case why did not the framework try and re execute this map somewhere else?"
"neutral","Attaching the 10 findbugs reports for common and the various hadoop-tools projects and hadoop-auth."

"positive","Owen thanks for the slides."
"neutral","I don't see a direct relation between this issue and the issue of simplifying the implementation of efficient map-side joins (MAPREDUCE-1183 more or less)."
"neutral","File formats are forever."
"neutral","But I'm not convinced its wise to add such support to the exisiting Java-only container file formats."
"neutral","I don't however see that it follows that we should provide implementations of file formats with a large number of different serialization systems as that invites multiplicative long-term support issues."
"neutral","I'd prefer that we instead direct users towards a single preferred high-level serialization system and a single preferred container."
"neutral","We now need to migrate from these to a more expressive language-independent serialization system and container file."
"neutral","Google benefits tremendously by having a single standard serialization system and container file format."
"neutral","The further we depart from this the harder we make it to build systems like Dremel that multiply the utility of stored data."
"neutral","Changing serialization systems or file formats is a major imposition for many applications."
"neutral","They cannot afford to do it frequently."
"neutral","Fixed TestCompositeService to not depend on test-order and thus made it pass on JDK7."
"neutral","Contributed by Thomas Graves."
"neutral","@Andy I have some thing which is similar to this and sorry if am diverting the current JIRA title."
"neutral","Assume the PUT(and related things) that i created in preBatchPut is also needed while i use the preWALWrite is there any way i can carry it in one flow?"
"neutral","Hope am not missing anything?"
"neutral","If you feel this can be done may be we can file an Improvement JIRA."
"neutral","How about renaming leftResults as remainingResults ?"
"neutral","Please prepare patch for trunk."
"neutral","Thanks"
"neutral","How about fixing WHIRR-337 before?"
"neutral","It should simplify things."
"neutral","The whole system could be out-of-service in case the Region of SequenceFile of the -ROOT- can NOT be opened."

"neutral","If it's OK sometimes and not others than IllegalArgumentException seems appropriate seems like it should never be legitimate to create a FileStatus w/o a path unless using the no argument constructor.  "

"neutral","Glad to see people are interested in this."
"neutral","This should (and can) be automated. "
"neutral","Could you verify if there is still an issue with a 5.6 snapshot."
"neutral","My suspicion is that it will be resolved."
"neutral","Hadrian I wonder if we can add a _warning_ to the 2.0 release notes about the missing hash and sign files."

"neutral","Found when attempting to compile Xalan-J 2 with gcj."
"neutral","Fixed in 1.2 branch as well."
"neutral","What is the right process to deprecate this behavior in 3.x?"
"neutral","We could also try to detect the behavior and log a warning... but i'm not sure that is worth much.  "
"neutral","Changes appeared in 10.8.1 documentation so closing."
"neutral","retrospectively setting fix version in preparation for SDO M3"
"neutral","Solution looks as follows: when doing a cluster sync whether it is for reading or writing always acquire the version manager's read lock first."
"neutral","Patch adds javadoc for the newly added tests."
"neutral","Right and right after that is the section I was referring to."
"neutral","Hi Andreas  as we are a bank we can't provide you with the normal documents as they are internal documents."

"neutral","Bulk close for 3.1"
"neutral","Mailing Lists to be set up before this cab be done."
"neutral","I really think there is an added value with this function for Jackrabbit users I personnally use it with every String-ordered query."
"neutral","No - unfortunately I do not have enough knowledge to digg into OpenJPA's code"
"neutral","That is correct."
"neutral","I mistakenly thought 10.9 was supposed to work on Java 1.4 (in fact the 10.9.1 release notes say it is supported although we removed support for it after 10.8) and the build worked in my environment because I had j14lib set and the test ran just fine on 1.4."
"neutral","I'll post a patch that makes 10.9 compile the test against 1.5 instead of 1.4."
"neutral","The patch that broke the build on 10.9 was also backported to 10.8."
"neutral","However on 10.8 it is correct to compile the test against 1.4 so that's not a problem."
"neutral","Here are the results of testing the latest attachment    http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12605661/MAPREDUCE-5538.6.patch   against trunk revision ."
"neutral","The patch does not contain any @author tags."
"neutral","I still can't work out how to do this."
"neutral","Igor suggested moving the call to Component#onBeforeRenderChildren() inside Component#onBeforeRender() but if I do that I get an NPE in the ListView#renderItem() method even for basic code."
"neutral","Hmm the suggested patch is not good for DRLVM which handles ""-version"" normally."
"neutral","What is the point to print only launcher version after all?"
"neutral","The following had serialVersionUID set for the 2.2 release."
"neutral","There have been no new ones added for 2.3."
"neutral","So when 2.3 is released you shouldn't get the problems you've had from 2.1 to 2.2 for these files."

"neutral","New patch that includes those changes."

"neutral","The patch does not contain any @author tags."

"neutral","{color:green}+1 core tests{color}."
"neutral","The patch passed unit tests in ."
"neutral","Fxied and regression test written"
"neutral","These 3 crashes happen while compiling DocumentWriter.invertDocument."
"neutral","It must be a bug in Sun's hotspot compiler."
"neutral","That method which inverts a single document was replaced with new code starting with 2.3 so it's possible you can workaround the bug by upgrading to 2.3 or 2.4."
"neutral","Improve patch : when the flexibleString is resolved search fields on root context and parameters map."
"neutral","Yes but even for Java 5 a relative path to a directory with flattened dependencies would be shorter wouldn't it?"
"neutral","Committed to 0.92 and trunk."
"neutral","The idea behind this is largely the same as with our existing package structure - there is nothing technical in preventing *everything* to be in the org.apache.jspwiki -namespace (with no subpackages) but both aesthetics and experience tell us that it just makes sense to add subpackages to make class management easier."
"neutral","In the same vein isolating the API interfaces into a separate package makes it a lot easier to manage than having everything dispersed around - e.g."
"neutral","if we want to create a jspwiki-api.jar we only need to jar up the contents of a particular subdirectory."
"neutral","If the developer wants to know whether he is using any possibly unstable components all he needs to do is to glance at the set of import statements on the top - if he's using other classes than org.apache.jspwiki.api."
"neutral","* he knows that the classes are potentially unstable."
"neutral","In addition it makes the committer's life easier since there is an agreement by convention that the APIs inside *.api are not to be touched without common agreement whereas anything outside of this package can be treated with more liberties."
"neutral","What's the purpose of this line in the patch to BaseTestCase Kristian?"
"neutral","Hi Julien please have a look on ./test/cpp/TestServer.cpp It's doing exactly what you what to do but TFramedTransport is explicitly specified there."
"neutral","It looks like HLog main has support to invoke --split."
"neutral","Does it looks like if I call that on the log that it will put split it and put the data into the right place?"
"neutral","We had a handful of regionservers go OOM yesterday while a MR job was doing heavy writes to a column family that doesn't usually get them."
"neutral","In this case the first OOM occurred here during writing the checksum."
"neutral","How about patch 2?"
"neutral","I added a ""."""
"neutral","So we are sure how to parse it no matter how hadoop/platform changes."
"neutral","Hi Senaka  That is exactly what I'd like to do i.e. automatic download of CA cert and go ahead."
"neutral","Is this possible?"
"neutral","This is also known as ""how it is stored in the SQL engine"" [JDBC]."
"neutral","For historical reasons in some (all?)"
"neutral","cases the values in a derby."

"neutral","I couldn't reproduce this."
"neutral","Ted can you reproduce this outside of cassidy.pl?"
"neutral","Thanks for the response."
"positive","Thanks a lot for sharing that Josh!"
"neutral","I like the idea of making sure that things that should be specified should be passed as method parameters in one go rather than through chaining which makes it a lot harder to see what is required."
"neutral","Regarding Doug's points...  > But perhaps the preferred import should instead be 'import static SchemaBuilder.*'?"
"neutral","The static methods have unique-enough names that this might work well."
"neutral","> We can convert from Java object to JsonNode by parsing the output of GenericData.toString(Object)."
"neutral","Thanks."
"neutral","I've updated the patch to do this but it still needs tests for this part."
"neutral","I'm thinking of multiple concurrent mutateRows operation trying to lock the same set of rows."
"neutral","Perhaps throwing IOException is going to prevent us from a situation where we end up with a deadlock."
"neutral","But we still might want to sort it to ensure (better) progress (no livelock)."
"neutral","Unless I'm missing something your patch doesn't actually change how the version is checked only how it's computed."
"neutral","Did you intend to combine our patches or is your patch incomplete?"
"neutral","[bulk update] Close all resolved issues that haven't been updated for more than one year."

"neutral","Added patch to support configuration mapping"
"neutral","Wonky."

"negative","It is a nasty bug that I've seen in real life though."
"neutral","Here's another crack at this:  1) The default behavior for Derby is the current behavior with all of its security holes for java routines."
"neutral","2) To get secure behavior for java routines the customer has to explicitly opt-in."
"neutral","Instead to access methods in the JRE you have to include little wrapper methods in your jar files that you loaded into the database."
"neutral","3c) The search order for customer-written routines is SQL standard: First we look in the jar file where the routine lives."
"neutral","Then we look in the other jar files in the order specified by SQLJ.ALTER_JAVA_PATH."
"neutral","Then we defer to the system class loader."
"neutral","3d) At runtime when we invoke the routine we make sure that it actually lives in the declared jar file. "

"neutral","Could you attach a test case (Junit preferrably) that shows the unexpected behaviour? "
"negative","I'm not sure what the problem is but the behavior (at least in 0.1.4) is that the _isClosed AtomicBoolean is not being set to closed in a timely manner."

"neutral","Is the bug really in NGramTokenFilter?"
"neutral","This seems to be a larger problem that would affect all tokenfilters that break larger tokens into smaller ones and recalculate offsets right?"
"neutral","I think WordDelimiterFilter has special code that might avoid the problem (line 352) so it might be ok.  Is there any better way we could solve this: for example maybe instead of the tokenizer calling correctOffset() it gets called somewhere else?"
"neutral","This seems to be what is causing the problem. "

"neutral","The problem is that no exception is raised if the other side of the connection dies."
"neutral","What will happen then is the read will infinitely read 0 bytes."
"neutral","So this actually avoid the infinite loop returning 0 (and so I think answered your second question so it wasn't very clear)."
"neutral","Note that without this patch there is an infinite loop that will hold a socket open forever (and consume cpu though very few probably in that case)."
"neutral","So this is not just merely a fix of deleting the tmp files."

"positive","Please let me know if you need something else."
"neutral","Regards  Leon   "
"neutral","Hey Uma I've elected not to revert the patch as-committed since it does indeed fix the bug at hand."
"positive","If you would like to take up this work that'd be great."

"neutral","Some folks on the mailing list had something like this happening to them."
"negative","> then we don't save IO by limiting the buffer size to 1 KB  I'm confused by this."
"neutral","My assumption is that when you make a request to read 1k from a disk file that the OS reads substantially more than 1k from the disk and places it in the buffer cache."
"neutral","(The cost of randomly reading 1k is nearly the same as randomly reading 100k--both are dominated by seek.)"
"neutral","So if you make another request to read 1k shortly thereafter you'll get it from the buffer cache and the incremental cost will be that of making a system call."
"neutral","An alternate strategy is to not trust the buffer cache and read-ahead but rather to make your buffers large enough so that transfer time dominates seeks."
"neutral","This can require 1MB or larger buffers so isn't always practical."
"neutral","Is that what you meant?"
"positive","[~lhofhansl] thank you so much."
"neutral","I will upload another patch (V5) in a couple minutes."
"neutral","Patch uploaded."
"neutral","Have passed all the local unit tests."

"neutral","I can see leaning toward to selects from the FLUSHER table with explicit checkpoints is a good balance for this case."
"positive","However the goal of the test was very good."
"neutral","I am not aware of whether we have test to fill the page cache with new data evicting all pages currently in the cache so the row count changes are written at a known point in time."

"neutral","Shouldn't we try to make this idiom work well with HDFS? "
"neutral","I guess the gen stamp is unnecessary but the DN isn't going to automatically mlock newly appended data so the NN needs to somehow realize that the cached length is shorter than the new length and ask the DN to recache at the new length."
"neutral","Alternatively I guess the DN could automatically mlock appended data but there are quota implications there."
"neutral","On startup I agree that we can skip cache reports until the cache is populated."
"neutral","I guess I could have cleaned this up rather than just changing the default cache report period like Colin asked."
"neutral","Uploaded a patch that fixes the comments and includes the test"
"neutral","Thanks for the review."
"neutral","We used to do 'stopping'."
"neutral","Smile."
"neutral","I think just needed for this at mo."
"positive","That's a good point we should make sure that it doesn't decrease performance for one of the database types even if it increases it for Oracle (in which case making it configurable in oozie-site.xml would be a good idea too).  "
"negative","Sigh I don't like this overall if can't reuse everywhere."
"negative","Sorry to let you lose a wild goose chase."
"neutral","Because this neither-here-nor-there code-reuse seems not much useful."
"negative","This half-reuse is more confusing for new devs who see this code for the first time."
"neutral","fully agree Christian!"
"negative","Sorry probably a misunderstanding from my side...."
"neutral","I refereed to the [^v1-enable-wall-werror.patch] which contains {{-Wall -Werror}} and I thought it sould be {{-Wall -Wextra}}  However just add {{-Wall}}  to that patch makes absolutely sense and could be committed."
"negative","I meet the same problem on Eclipse recently but haven't figured out how to get through."
"negative","Sorry Chris  I missed it done !"
"negative","We reported this crash to Oracle in plenty of time and the *worse* wrong-results bug has been open since May 13: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=7044738 but Oracle decided not to fix that too. "

"neutral","But if we go with PayloadMergeProcessor we'll need PayloadMergeProcessorProvider and they become quite long names :)."
"neutral","I was thinking PayloadProcessor and PayloadProcessorProvider (have cool acronyms to PP and PPP) but then people might get confused that it processes all payloads (maybe before they are even written the first time) while it is actually invoked only during segment merges.I was following the *Consumer pattern I saw all over the place w/ SegmentMerger and thought that if someone ever reads SM code it will swallow easily another *Consumer one ..."

"neutral","Need it to test the fix."
"neutral","I changed the ubuntu version too."
"neutral","By the way getCanonicalPath() performs actual file access may take long if drive is slow (e. g. Samba) may fail with exception if path is inaccessible at the moment (e. g. on network drive) etc."
"neutral","On the other hand getAbsolutePath() is purely logical and doesn't need file system access. "
"negative","You misunderstood the response: StopFilter indeed did not change."
"neutral","The change is now that in Lucene 4.0 all Analyzers are required to reuse TokenStream instances so the StopFilter is only produced only once in your application (when the Analyzer is created)."
"negative","You would need to implement session resume thats a whole new can of worms."
"neutral","This test pukes all over the place when the first test fails."
"neutral","Some of the other test cases in this class failed because that constraint error occurred?"

"neutral","Marking as critical."
"negative","Seems we didn't enforce an exec for sh but we did for fs."
"neutral","@Jon Thanks for committing it."
"neutral","The failure of GdiplusStartup happened to because this function was called from a native method with RSP not aligned to 16 bytes."
"neutral","It is not well documented in MSDN but it looks like RSP has to be always aligned to 16 bytes."
"neutral","Some functions don't require it but some do."
"neutral","A patch was made to the interpreter to fix this in assembly code so if a native method has an odd number of arguments additional 8 bytes are skilled by RSP to align it to 16 bytes."
"neutral","So I am likely going to work on this soon."
"neutral","What is the exact problem?"
"neutral","If it would as simple as just recreating ReplicationZookeeper or using RecoverableZookeeper J-D would have probably just done it :) "
"neutral","You forgot to mention the part where I said that I have absolutely no idea if MinSize is important for some other part of the code )  Also it looks like if we add a check in couch_db:doc_flush_binaries/2 to see if we're not streaming an attachment of unknown length and then pass that information to couch_stream:ensure_buffer/2 so that couch_stream can decide if it wants to allocate exactly the requested amount or some extra it'd solve the issue."
"neutral","The two issues mentioned by Tom has been fixed."
"neutral","The new patch is the whirr-168-3.patch file."
"negative","Igor sorry it took me so long to get back to this."
"neutral","Thanks for the patch."
"neutral","It works for me both in container and in testing with WicketTester. "
"negative","I found the (sad) attempt at a script you asked about and uploaded it to MAPREDUCE-4282."
"neutral","As I said on that thread I'm in a compilers class right now and I thought I might make a more ""enlightened"" attempt using lex/yacc soon and see where that gets me if no one else gets this done first."
"negative","Sorry for the delay."
"neutral","anyway if someone is brave enough to fix the ""attempt one"" script i wish them well ) "
"neutral","I added a rm -rf /tmp/h* to hadoopqa... and ran this again.... seems to be working:  https://builds.apache.org/view/H-L/view/HBase/job/PreCommit-HBASE-Build/7253/console  We'll see."
"neutral","by the way the only open impl of this algorithm i could find is at http://rrette.com/moman.html (ZSpell) in python."
"neutral","I might be on the trail of a java impl - get out the hounds!"
"neutral","If you do take hold of it do not hesitate to share :) The original paper and C++ code likewise melt my brain and I needed the algo in some other place."
"neutral","We can file issues with it as we find them."
"negative","I don't have resources to hand to test this at mo."
"neutral","Hi Deepa I looked at the transaction logs afaict this is not a bug rather the znode you mention is not deleted on session expiration because it was already explicitly deleted by another session."
"neutral","afaict things are working properly at least on the ZK side of things. "
"neutral","FWIW: this issue is a regression of JCR-890 i.e."
"neutral","the refactoring involved (r982520)."
"neutral","there might be more hidden issues like this."
"negative","but app developers should always explicitly set it based on their application  My guess is that a large enough group of people take the defaults that it matters."
"neutral","I wasn't talking about the perment schedule."
"negative","Excuse me for stolen assignement."
"neutral","I've saw this after completed the issue."
"neutral","I think it will be useful to standardize all the messages."
"negative","In current version the same error cause different messages because there are many commiters."
"negative","Must be: size >= 0!"
"neutral","Marking this an incompatible change so that it gets attention."
"neutral","Also setting webinterface.private.actions has other effects like enabling the 'kill job' and 'kill task' links on the Job web UI."
"neutral","In that case the NN should delay creating a replication-storm in the hope that the network partition gets resolved soon."

OTOH they probably  care more about successfully migrating their 1.0.2 app to 1.1 and this is just getting in the way.   If they really want to know why their call to setLoginTimeout isn't working they can check the  included javadoc.  So if you decide it's a bug then there's a patch coming..."

"neutral","Hi Guillaume  I think that what you are saying is right and i find ( despite is on the specification or not ) that to have the error status is quite useful.  But i don't agree that if InOnly MEP terminate with an ERROR status it should propagated back.  I agree totally with Gianfranco this should be done only when we're working in sync mode otherwise it's better not  to propagate the error back and use feature like restart from the failure point that we've just implemeted.

"positive","Hi Michael thank you for your answer. I thought that it would not be so easy to solve this issue. Unfortunately.  I agree with you that the main problem here is that a copy action is missing and I guess AttachStrategy.persist is the right place to add some kind of copy functionality.  I started looking into the source code of the enhanced class from the test. PersistenceCapable declares a public method to copy fields (pcCopyFields(...)). Unfortunately you can't use in AttachStrategy.persist because the entity to persist has no statemanager at this point (an exception InvalidStateException will be the result).  My suggestion is to modify the class enhancement and remove the StateManager check in pcCopyFields (I don't see the need for this check).  Afterwards you can use pcCopyFields in AttachStrategy.persist by adding something like      ...         if (manager.getCopyNew()) {             int[] fields = new int[meta.getFields().length]"

"positive","Hi Bilgin  you are right the entitymode.xml can be removed but I when I add it I'm thinking to add a new filed to PosTerminalInternTx  entity to store ""Pos Paid Reason"" instead of store it in the reasonComment field.  I have already created some enumeration into DemoPosData.xml but it is still not been used. There are still a lot of things that has been not implemented or not working so contribution from other people are welcome. Removing the hardcoded value pos-1 into WebPosEvents.java at line 77 is something still to be done.

I then imported the application which was a bit frustrating as it didn't seem to accomplish much.

"positive","1. My feeling is that ""if (file.lastModified() < now + ACCESS_TIME_RESOLUTION)"" is not necessary since the lastModified value will already be truncated to the system resolution but I do not think it is harmful.  2. I chose to throw exception only if file.canWrite because I was trying to minimise the impact of the change. It's not clear to me whether setLastModified might work when !file.canWrite. However it certainly must work (because of GC) if file.canWrite. I would consider moving the canWrite test outside of the setLastModified call similar to getRecordIfStored it just wasn't necessary to fix the immediate problem.  3. Well not swallowed exactly but caught and converted to failure return code (-1) e.g. see BLOBInDataStore.getSize. In any case the javadoc for Property.getLength/getLengths documents -1 as a possible ""failure"" return code so it had to be tested. I think if Property.getLength/getLengths throws an exception that is already correctly handled.  Thanks for the quick response.  "

So for NTLM to work the proxy-auth header must be removed once authenticated.  I don't think either patch 2 or 3 handles this case unless (in the case of patch 2) the host also uses NTLM.  What we really need is a way to remove NTLM headers after the authentication has succeeded.  Mike"

"neutral","Yes bytes + comparator would work fine for jaql.  Preferably it would be the same comparators that are already used by the sort code which work on serialized bytes (but also on WritableComparables so that might be a problem).  If these comparators are inconsistent then the sort in map/reduce will not work properly.  I think it is ok to document the transitivity requirement but I don't see how you can enforce it in any way.  Different key types are fine as long as the comparator knows how to handle them.  If you can't reuse the same comparator interface I can always implement my comparisons in another place but I already have two of them (one in the WritableComparable and one in the Comparator).  I don't see how column families and the key comparator are related except that they are both table-level metadata. Yes I agree that a single comparator would be used for the entire table. "

"negative","Hello   Sure you are right here I didn't make myself clear enough Im sorry.  As you (and RFC959) say when we are sending the file we should transform to NVT-ASCII but not when we are receiving the file. In this second case i think that the expected behaviour is that the text message be written to a file with the default line separator for the platform.          The sender converts the data from an internal character             representation to the standard 8-bit NVT-ASCII             representation (see the Telnet specification).  The receiver             will convert the data from the standard form to his own             internal form.   Actually  according to the spec before a RETR ASCII operation is transformed we should be converting the charset to ASCII  for our machine could be using EBCDIC  to store files and clients are supposed to expect that files are encoded in NVT-ASCII.  So I don't know ... Any way this has little priority for me (until someone using a non-ascii-compatible encoding complains) so we could leave this for the future. Any way I don't like ASCII mode for it breaks  the 'REST' command. My implementation only supports binary mode.      "

"neutral","I haven't spent enough time thinking about this but I think it is more than just fixing the error message string. It seems that the comparable method in DTD should return int rather than boolean and the return int value will decide if we should throw what we are throwing today (ie something like ERROR 42818: Comparisons between 'VARCHAR' and 'CHAR' are not supported. ) or throw a new message because collations don't match.

I did this because I didn't want to mess with the QueryRunner code if everyone thought my idea was stupid.

"neutral","Released in ClickIDE 2.2.0.0."
"positive","> Have checked in this change which can be reviewed here: http://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/click/?cs=766349  > Would appreciate any feedback.  I just have the feeling this entire ControlRegistry is growing over our heads. Taking a look at many older applications with older Click releases I can't stop thinking that Click was very good for years without it. I also received a few custom components for maintenance and I don't think this change (nor ControlRegistry) is of any needed in them (or maybe simply I'm not getting the entire concept).  Of course I'm a newbie but my impression is that most of the advantages you list are for ClickClick. Is it possible that the problem is with the ClickClick  approach(and that should be changed) not with Click?  Many parts of Click are simple to understand and nice but this one is not. Making it even more complex is just a guarantee that users like me will understand it even less.  From what I saw one of the most important parts of Click is backward compatibility. For this however Click should remain very simple otherwise it will get big and bloated(and it can't afford ""published"" experiments). Tapestry on the other and can do this since with every new version they throw aboard the entire compatibility so ""experiments"" if go wrong are not that a problem - and history shows that complex things always go wrong sooner or later (latest one: with T5.2 they'll trow maven away now :) )  My wish is when I look at the Click source code to be able to quickly understand what's up there - cause only so I have a good feeling when I use it  in applications (otherwise I have that ""black box feeling"" - and it's not fun ).  I think like this are most users - those who prefer complex thing have a very huge choice of concurrent frameworks :). "

I don't think anyone is really using names long enough for them to it the file system limit the goal of limiting the names is just so to prevent this from happening but there will be no other assumption that the names are short from the code.  I also don't think anything will prevent rolling upgrades do you had something in mind?  Note: I have a long flight ahead of me so I plan to update my last patch with both those changes as I still like the moving of all the directories handling in a dedicated class even if we don't support both layout."
"neutral","Did you get a chance to try a patched build?"
"neutral","Truth is that the sheer size of CFStore (over 2K line) annoys me. I think this prove CFStore has too much things in it and we messed up at encapsulation. So I tried to make DataTracker be about dealing with the memtables and sstables as much as possible. And being able to have View not leak from DataTracker sound like a proof that we do have some encapsulation there. I'm not claiming it's perfect but I really don't think that CFStore is our most beautiful class in there and I do believe that DataTracker improves this a bit.  But there is a good part of subjectivity in all this anyway. And if people really don't like the move of the bits of querying in there fine I'd move them back in CFStore and leak the View from DataTracker. I would however be more reluctant to remove DataTracker altogether and put the AtomicReference in CFStore. Because this would move all the CAS related logic in CFStore and seriously there is already too much stuff in CFStore. My humble opinion though. "

"positive","I'll look into the namespace handler. Thanks.  Yes I should have added the different event handling support to the TODO above. I need to think more about this and look into the camel code a bit more. Using just the endpoint api I couldn't create routes on the fly hence the polling consumer approach.  I'll keep hacking away at in in my toolbox when customer needs dictate.  Am I missing something in your approach how would I do this then in the XML DSL using your approach?  I think virtual routing is a known limitation of Camel when you start to deploy large scale systems. Out of curiosity have you seen camel ever been deployed with 1000's of routes (and/or routes files)? I think this would have FD and thread overkill problems. Everything repeats itself :)  "
"neutral","JB do you expect problems when we upgrade Camel 2.10.0 to Spring 3.1.0 (and deploy it into Karaf 2.2.x)? Because Camel leverage on the Karaf Spring feature it will use Spring 3.0.x when running inside Karaf 3.0x and Spring 3.1.x when running in Karaf 3.0.x.   IMO when we can upgrade to Spring 3.1.0 without any modification it should not a problem..."

"neutral","It also includes a corresponding change in java2wsdl to handle the two-way void return case correctly."
"neutral","One final note the error handling should have its own JIRA so that it is addressed one day?"
"neutral","I only needed to let MarkupResourceStream also implement it."
"neutral","It seems to work fine for me when i test locally the markup is only created once per fixed location and then access through  cachekey -> locationstring -> markup  So if locationString doesn't work we get this:  cachekey -> cachekey -> markup  But i guess that is a very small percentage if there is even 1 on this planet...  should we include this into 1.3.2?"

"neutral","the configuration in the POM works fine with 2.4.3."
"neutral","I have some comments on the new patch:  PermDescriptor  o You should remove the permUUID field from this class since it shadows the oid field in the superclass."
"neutral","I think you are right to follow the existing patterns."
"neutral","This is something we can revisit when we collapse all of the permissions catalogs into the master catalog which you are creating."
"neutral","This will speed up the check in DataDictionaryImpl.isSchemaEmpty()."
"neutral","If so then I would recommend adding a third index."
"neutral","Note that if you swap the key order then you will need to make a corresponding change to DataDictionaryImpl.getSequenceDescriptor(String SchemaDescriptor)   o I think that buildColumnList() should return an array of 10 column descriptors one for each column in the table."
"neutral","See for instance the corresponding method in SYSALIASESRowFactory."
"neutral","EmptyDictionary  o I think that you can remove the stub for dropSequenceDescriptor(String TransactionController) because you have removed this method from the DataDictionary interface."
"neutral","DataDictionaryImpl  o The header comments on getUncachedPermDescriptor() getPermDescriptor() and dropAllPermDescriptors() look like they were copied from pre-existing methods so they should be revised to describe the new methods."
"neutral","See previous comments for earlier commit."
"neutral","Thanks Greg! "
"neutral","Vinicus patch only includes a single file (the failing junit) all Uwe need to do is to apply the patch to the moved file is that correct?"

"neutral","Are there any (future?)"

"neutral","This causes pretty big data structures as many of our CMaps cover 65k possible mappings!"
"neutral","We should use a more efficient in-memory representation for such range mappings."
"neutral","I have added some buttons to help put variables and patterns."
"neutral","applies to trunk too"
"neutral","Also #3 seems to be fairly simple with a single ""around"" advice in aspectj and a couple of lines for ajc target in build.xml."
"neutral","There are no extra lines of code or maintenance it is the simplest solution."
"neutral","As long as the change is applied at build time I don't see any real drawback.  "

"neutral","I think I'm ready for commit soon."
"neutral","For my larger suppliers I will often have a 100 or more requirements built up."
"neutral","Since the ""Approved Requirements"" screen paginates the requirements I'll end up generating multiple orders for the same (large) supplier simply because the application operates a page at a time."
"neutral","This annoys my suppliers a bit."
"neutral","I guess the obvious thing to do is to go in and reconfigure the pagination so it doesn't (paginate) but if we had the ability to add items to existing POs then you could still use the pagination mechanism and build up the PO page-by-page (quite handy if your working through  your POs during less busy times of the day).  "
"neutral","I did that first but then remembered that when I did that in the past people were unable to apply my patches w/o doing the svn move themselves."

"neutral","If regionnames were made of tablename+endrow instead of tablename+startrow then in the metatables doing a search for the region that contains the wanted row we'd just have to open a scanner using passed row and the first row found by the scan would be that of the region we need (If offlined parent we'd have to scan to the next row)."
"neutral","If we were using scans prewarming client cache would be near costless (as opposed to what we'll currently have to do which is first a getClosestRowBefore and then a scan from the closestrowbefore forward)."

"neutral","I believe the notifications are now scheduled properly."
"neutral","Am I missing the connection or is this a distinct issue?"
"neutral","More variations add significant long-term compatibility burdens to the project."
"neutral","We badly need to add support for a higher-level object serialization system than Writable."
"neutral","So I'm all for a more generic serialization API that can be used by MapReduce applications."
"neutral","Historically that's been Writable and SequenceFile."
"neutral","Our APIs should be of course be general enough that it's possible to incorporate different serialization systems and different file formats but we needn't provide implementations of all combinations of these but should rather direct folks towards a primary implementation."
"neutral","The Dremel paper (http://sergey.melnix.com/pub/melnik_VLDB10.pdf) argues that this is an essential enabler of their wide variety of interoperable systems."
"neutral","We should provide a clear path forward from Writable+SequenceFile to a new system that's easier to use less fragile and language-independent to better facilitate a rich ecosystem of tools."

"neutral","Note: the attached patch does not break the existing API"
"neutral","What would you think of just exposing incRef() & decRef() as expert public methods?"
"neutral","#NAME?"
"neutral","We would just add ensureOpen() to those methods and make them public."
"neutral","The zip is already large and contains all code."
"neutral","Using maven you can easily generate the docs yourself."
"neutral","Or even better: use the maven repository to automatically attach the sources-jar to your eclipse/idea/netbeans project."
"neutral","The comparison with 1.2.6 is not valid as we use a different setup now and ship everyting in one zip instead of a zip per project.."

"neutral","If I commit it as-is we could miss some help."
"neutral","Patch to address the issue."
"neutral","I have found the source of the problem - yet I completely don't understand why such an unrelated thing breaks navigation."
"neutral","As soon as I remove wicket enclosure or add some text node inside - the navigation toolbar starts properly counting pages (it was showing 0 of 0 before because it thinks it is not visible in hierarchy)."
"neutral","Also adds the tests to the _Suite class."
"neutral","I've modified the patch to name the function rep.normalize  If you think that my proposal is actually not enough ambitious for being called ""normalization"" do you prefer something like rep:toASCII which may seem less universal ?"
"neutral","The build seems to have broken on 10.9 when the test was backported."
"neutral","It only breaks if j14lib is not set."
"neutral","The problem is that I changed the build script to use java14compile.classpath instead of java15compile.classpath for the new test when I backported it from 10.10."

"neutral","Or to be precise a mostly equivalent set of APIs JCR requires some modifications which would make it complicated to support the existing set of APIs - mainly because we need to carry state information in a WikiContext which the old API signatures do not mostly support."

"neutral","Thanks."
"neutral","In the wiki next to each one of these parameters it explicitly says that reducing this parameter will decrease memory usage this is why we reduced these parameters (it did not mention the filterCache at all)."
"neutral","Also the savings are largely index side - not likely a huge part of your RAM concerns which are search side."
"neutral","My filterCache stats are great- you know it's set to 64K but right now with almost all the RAM used up (we're at 71.9% now) but it's only using 36290 entries at the moment and it's holding pretty steady there(even as RAM usage increased by 10%)."
"neutral","We have no cache evictions at all but a 99% hit ratio."
"neutral","The sizes may be higher than you need then."
"neutral","I was originally suggesting you might sacrifice speed with the caches for RAM - but its always best to use the best settings and have the necessary RAM."
